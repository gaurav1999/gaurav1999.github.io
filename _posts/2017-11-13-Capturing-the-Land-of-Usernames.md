Here's my first blog post and I decided to keep this a casual one and came up with the topic of discussing my  trip to the first destination **"The land of Usernames"**
in this neverending voyage .
<!--more--> 

## How things began?

Dating back to the *literature lessons* in school , was the first instance of me coming across the concept of *pen names* used by the writers.This indeed aroused a desire in me to associate myself with one to get a cloak to disguise myself.

**So why did it take me such a long leap to get one?** I didn't have a great interest in writing so where would I use a pen name. 
**Did that mean I should put aside my desire?** Certainly no ,by the time I had completed with my high school , I had figured out my interest in the software world ,and voila here comes the apt place to use a disguise .

## Let's ponder for a while 

Amidst everything in the world, I am very fond of **stars** in particular, reasons being clear,they are **inanimate** ,you don't have to bother about their behaviour which is certainly **predictable** unlike the animate elements.  
Have you ever wondered that it's  a star which keeps blazing even when it's the day time until the fateful day of its fuel depletion is reached .I must say ,stars indeed are a source of illumination and eternal enlightenment. So you can make them your dedicated companion for the span of entire 24 hours .*(you won't have even your dearest friend the entire day with you , but a star will surely be)*

 >I require this a lot because the silly me gets into various issues while working on development and at times need to spend nights trying to hack them.

Finally , I firmly finalised to choose my zodiac sign's brightest star **ANTARES** to be my user name for my accounts.
>If you did scatch your head for a while you could have guessed my zodiac sign too ;p


Here comes a twist ,my username on github *(aakp10)* unlike my gitlab account *(antares)* doesn't comply with my username choice I've been blabbering about for a while.That's because there are some hundred odd users with the same username on github ,that meant not having a completely unique identity and hence my decision.

I hope you could get some insight into my journey .

_Thanks for reading !_

*Bon Voyage ! and continue with your voyages until I post about the  insight into my journey of setting up this blog .*
