It’s been a month since the [__Outreachy__ Round 15](https://www.outreachy.org/) results were announced . Yay! my proposal for adding a network panel to [__GNOME Usage__](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Usage) was selected.
I am glad to be working on something I personally have been longing for. Moreover, I finally have something to cut down on my  Xbox addiction and channelize it into bringing the network panel to life.   
It’s going to be really amazing working with my mentor [Felipe Borges](https://wiki.gnome.org/FelipeBorges) , and Usage's co-maintainer [Petr Stetka](https://wiki.gnome.org/PetrStetka) ,given their experience and expertise.

## Here’s a walkthrough of what the project is all about:

Currently there are not many Linux based __GUI tools__ to monitor __network statistics__ on our system ,unlike the CLI tools. *Network Panel* in [__GNOME-Usage__](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Usage) will serve the purpose of making a __UI__ available at the user’s service enabling them to monitor their network in a *process oriented manner*.

This panel can be designed to provide not only the __per-process data transfer__ rates ,but also other details : __open ports__ dedicated to some service *(this can be of a great use to start or stop services from a UI )*, list of __interfaces__. Currently it’s not finalized what all additional data will be available apart from the data transfer rates, but this panel surely has loads of new things in store for the users.

Lately, I’ve been  discussing with my mentor regarding the approach for the __backend API__ , which we plan to be incorporated in [libgtop](https://github.com/GNOME/libgtop). As the [Outreachy round](https://www.outreachy.org/) officially started yesterday ,I plan to dig into the libgtop codebase and get started with coding ,the most amazing part of this internship !

This week onwards, I will be regular with my blog posts , updating about my progress on the project.  
Lots in store for the geeky network enthusiasts looking forward to having a new compelling  look to otherwise conventional network details.

*Stay tuned!* :)
