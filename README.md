# Jekyll Blog 

This is the source code of my [blog](https://gaurav1999.github.io) which is generated by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)  

I have tweaked the original [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme to customize it.

# Additional Features

This is basically an [About page](https://gaurav1999.github.io/) of the blogger 

## Recent Posts 

A separate page is rendered for paginating the recent posts


## Categories

Posts can be segregated into their respective categories

## Tags

Posts can be segregated into their respective tags

## Archive

Archive tab would let the user get a quick glimpse of the chronologized blog post

## Comments

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) being a static site generator **doesn't** have any database associated where the comments can be logged.I have integrated [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) comments (a third part commenting system).
