## _Hey there, I am Gaurav Agrawal !_
Currently working as Backend Engineer at **[Zenius](https://zenius.net)**, where I design, develop and maintain Backend microservices catering to 15million+ learners. Tech that I use at work is mostly Node Js, AWS, Kafka, Apollo Graphql, Mongo DB etc.

In past I have contributed to **GNOME Foundation** where I served as  Foundation member, worked on maintaining Newcomer Contribution guides,
organized workshops, and [contributed](https://gitlab.gnome.org/gaurav1999) to apps like GNOME Gitg, Builder, Sound Recorder etc.

Apart from Work, I love to teach, write and engage with Community. Which is why I have started exploring Technical Writing and Jamstack Open Source Communities.


 

Feel free to connect with me :)
